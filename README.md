I started programming by coding Minecraft plugins in Java when I was 14. From there on, I have looked into various fields. At the moment, my focus lies in web development because it's our current main focus in school. In my free time, I'm still very passionate about OOP and am currently deepening my knowledge of Kotlin. I really like to invest a lot of time in making good-looking designs, clean architectures, and writing readable and concise code.

## Some of my projects
#### I have a few cool Minecraft plugins over at my discontinued GitHub account:
- [Languify](https://github.com/Hekates/Languify), a library to make Minecraft plugins multilingual.
- [OreBan](https://github.com/Hekates/OreBan), a plugin that adds an innovative solution to a common hacking problem on Minecraft servers.

#### My current (sadly mostly school) projects can be found down below in my Pins (↓) or under my [repositories](https://github.com/timlandolt?tab=repositories).
