I started programming by coding Minecraft plugins in Java when I was 14. From there on, I have looked into various fields. At the moment, my focus lies in full stack web development in the rails ecosystem, as I currently work in this field. In my free time I'm passionate about everything that can be done with Kotlin (if I happen to find time alongside fencing, playing bass, and scouting).

## Some of my projects
#### I have a few cool Minecraft plugins over at my discontinued GitHub account:
- [Languify](https://github.com/Hekates/Languify), a library to make Minecraft plugins multilingual.
- [OreBan](https://github.com/Hekates/OreBan), a plugin that adds an innovative solution to a common hacking problem on Minecraft servers.

#### My current (sadly mostly school) projects can be found down below in my Pins (‚Üì) or under my [repositories](https://github.com/timlandolt?tab=repositories).
